          Kedarnath Dham, located in the Garhwal Himalayan ranges, has a rich
          history dating back to the ancient ages of Hindu religion.0 The temple
          is believed to have been built by the Pandavas and is one of the
          twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva.1 There are
          various versions about the origin of the temple, with some claiming it
          was built by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century and others by Raja
          Bhoj of Malwa in the 2nd century. <br /><br />The temple is not
          directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 km uphill
          trek from Gaurikund. Pony, mule, and manchan service is available to
          reach the temple.1 The history of Kedarnath Dham can be traced back to
          the great sage, saint, and philosopher Adi Shankaracharya, who
          established a number of mutths, temples, and pilgrimages throughout
          the way from his birthplace in Kerala to Kedarnath

          Badrinath Temple was originally a Buddhist shrine until the 8th
          century when Adi Shankara converted it to a Hindu temple.1 According
          to Skand Puran, the idol of Lord Badrinath was recovered by Adiguru
          Shankaracharya from Narad Kund and re-enshrined in this temple.2 The
          temple has historical significance because it was installed by Adi
          Shankara and he set up his own people there
          <br /><br />

          Today, the descendants of the families that he set up traditionally,
          the Nambudiris, are the priests in the temple.0 The temple has a
          brightly colored exterior similar to that of Buddhist temples, leading
          to the argument that the architecture of the temple resembles a
          Buddhist temple

        <p class="text">
          Haridwar is a city with a rich history and spiritual significance.0
          The first modern-era written evidence of Haridwar is found in the
          accounts of a Chinese traveller, Huan Tsang, who visited India in 629
          CE. During the reign of King Harshavardhan, Haridwar was recorded as
          'Mo-yu-lo', which still exists at Mayapur, a little to the south of
          the modern town. Among the ruins are a fort and three temples,
          decorated with broken stone sculptures
          <br /><br />

          2 The Chandi Devi Temple, also known as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of
          the Panch Tirth (Five Pilgrimages) located within Haridwar.1 The
          temple was built under the former Shankaracharya Maha-Mandleshwar
          Swami Satyamitranand Giri Maharaj.2 The Maya Devi Temple is the site
          where the navel of Goddess Sati fell while Shiva was transporting her
          body. The current temple dates back to the 11th century and may have
          been built on a possibly more ancient temple

          <h2 class="discript">Rishikesh</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="text">
          Rishikesh was part of the legendary "Kedarkhand" mentioned in the
          Skanda Purana.[16] Legends state that Lord Rama did penance here for
          killing Ravana, the asura king of Lanka. Lakshmana, Rama's younger
          brother, crossed the Ganges using two jute ropes at the point where
          the present Lakshman Jhula (लक्ष्मण झूला) suspension bridge stands
          today. Lakshman Jhula also collapsed in 2020. And a much stronger, 2nd
          in the whole of India, a glass bridge, is being built across the
          river. [17] The 248-foot long iron-rope suspension bridge built in
          1889 was washed away by flooding in 1924. In 1927, it was replaced by
          the current, stronger bridge built by the United Provinces Public
          Works Department, connecting the Tapovan, Tehri, and Jonk, Pauri
          Garhwal districts.
          <br /><br />
           The Skanda Purana also mentions the site as
          "Indrakund" where Indra underwent a holy bath to remove a curse.The
          Ganges, one of the most sacred rivers to Hindus, flows through
          Rishikesh in its course from the Shivalik Hills of the Himalayas to
          the plains of northern India with temples built along the banks[3]
          Shatrughna Mandir, Bharat Mandir, and Lakshman Mandir are the ancient
          temples established by Adi Shankaracharya. Shatrughna Temple is near
          the Ram Jhula suspension bridge, while Lakshman Mandir is situated
          near the Lakshman Jhula suspension bridge.
